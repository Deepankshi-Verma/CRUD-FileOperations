# Student Management System

Welcome to the **Student Management System** project! This project is designed to help beginners familiarize themselves with industry-standard coding practices while working on file operations with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The project revolves around managing student records, providing functionalities to create, read, update, and delete student information.

## Introduction

In this project, we've developed a basic student management system. The core entity of the system is the **Student** class, which holds attributes such as roll number, name, date of birth, gender, and address. The project implements industry-standard design patterns and coding practices, making it an ideal starting point for beginners to learn about software development.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several components, each serving a specific purpose:

  - **`Student`**: Contains the `Student` class representing the student entity with getters and setters.
  - **`repository`**: Implements file operations for CRUD functionalities in the `StudentRepo` class.
  - **`service`**: Defines the `StudentService` interface and its implementation in `StudentServiceImpl`.
  - **`request`**: Contains request classes like `StudentRequest`, `SearchStudentRequest`, and `UpdateStudentRequest`.
  - **`App.java`**: Main application file containing user interaction cases.

- **`src/main/resources`**: Resources such as data files are stored here.

## Usage

The Student Management System offers the following functionalities:

1. **Create Student**: Enter student details like roll number, name, date of birth, gender, and address to create a new student record.

2. **Search Student**: Search for students by roll number or name and view their details.

3. **Update Student**: Update student information (name, gender, address) using the roll number as a reference.
